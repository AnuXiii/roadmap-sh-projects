An AI-powered quiz application built with Vite, TailwindCSS, and Toastify. Users can generate multiple-choice quizzes on any topic using the Gemini API, answer questions within a time limit, and view their score with animated feedback.

## Features

- **AI-generated quizzes:** Enter any topic and get a set of multiple-choice questions generated by Gemini.
- **Time-limited questions:** Each question has a countdown timer.
- **Score tracking:** See your score update in real-time and view your final score with a progress circle.
- **Animated UI:** Smooth transitions and feedback using custom CSS animations and Toastify notifications.
- **Responsive design:** Works well on desktop and mobile devices.
